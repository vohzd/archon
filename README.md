# Curator

intended to run without a _proper_ database (just writes to a .json file);

goals;
- enumerate/quantify _how_ many videos/repos you have and their respective filesize (to help with HDD purchasing)
- to provide a GUI wrapper around ffmpeg/youtube-dl/git etc to allow you to select/save to disk the things you need
